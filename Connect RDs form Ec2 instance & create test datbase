Task 10: Create a database, table and insert data for testing
Let's create a simple database and table to see if itâ€™s working.

Create a database:
>>CREATE DATABASE SchoolDB;
You can see the created database with following command:
>>show databases;
Switch to the database named SchoolDB.

>>use SchoolDB;
Create a sample table:
>>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS subjects (subject_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,subject_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,teacher VARCHAR(255),start_date DATE,lesson TEXT,PRIMARY KEY (subject_id)) ENGINE=INNODB;
 Enter to see the table you just created.
>>show tables;
Insert some details into the table:
>>INSERT INTO subjects(subject_name, teacher) VALUES ('English', 'John Taylor');
>>INSERT INTO subjects(subject_name, teacher) VALUES ('Science', 'Mary Smith');
>>INSERT INTO subjects(subject_name, teacher) VALUES ('Maths', 'Ted Miller');
>>INSERT INTO subjects(subject_name, teacher) VALUES ('Arts', 'Suzan Carpenter');
Let's check the items we added into the table:
>>select * from subjects;


Exit the Database

exit;
