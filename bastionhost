Task 10: SSH into Endpoint instance (Privately accessible) through Bastion host
SSH into the Bastion instance using the Bastion PEM key: WhizKey.pem

To SSH into Endpoint instance via the Bastion instance, we need the WhizKey.pem to be present on the Bastion instance.

Open the WhizKey.pem file on your local system and then copy the text content.

Navigate to the Bastion Instance and create a file named WhizKey.pem using the below command:  

vi WhizKey.pem
Paste the content and save it by pressing shift+colon  followed by :wq! and then enter to save your private key.

Make sure you have changed the permission of the key file to 400. You can change the permission using the below command:

chmod 400 WhizKey.pem


Now you can log into the web servers using the private key copied to the bastion server with the help of the below commands. 

Note: You don't have public IP's for the Endpoint instance since we created them in a private subnet.

Syntax : ssh -i WhizKey.pem  ec2-user@<Endpoint instance's Private IP>

Example: ssh -i WhizKey.pem  ec2-user@192.168.0.55.

When asked for confirmation type: yes
